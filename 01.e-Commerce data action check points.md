<p>Data actions are JavaScript functions that are used in the Dynamics 365 Commerce architecture to help fetch and map data that is required by modules across applications.
  Data actions offer improved performance through the following features:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Integrated application-level and request-level caches enable state sharing scenarios.</li>
  <li>Built-in utilities support batching to minimize the number of external requests that your application requires.</li>
  <li>Automatic deduplication helps guarantee that multiple data action calls aren't duplicated.</li>
<ul>
   
<p>The Dynamics 365 Commerce platform includes a set of core data actions that can be called from modules to do typical data retrieval. For example, core data actions can return product details. You can also create custom data actions to fetch and process data that is required by modules. </p>

<h2>2. Key parts of a data action </h2>
<ul>
   <li> Action function – The main function that contains the logic that is run when the action is called. This function might involve making application programming interface (API) calls, reading cookies, or transforming data that was passed in.</li>
   <li> Action input class – The class that is used to pass data into the action function. The "cacheObjectType" and "cacheKey" values indicate where in the cache the class should put the result of the action.</li>
   <li> createInput method – This optional method can be used to build an instance of an action input class that is used to load data when a page is first populated.</li>
<ul>
